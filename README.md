# LeetCode Solved Problems

| # | Title | Description | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Two Sum | Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. | [Solution](twosum.js) |
| 665 | Non-decreasing Array | Given an array nums with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element. We define an array is non-decreasing if nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] holds for every i (0-based) such that (0 <= i <= n - 2). | [Solution](non_decreasing_array.js) |
| 771 | Jewels and Stones | You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels. The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A". | [Solution](jewels_and_stones.js) |
| 1108 | Defanging an IP Address | Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address. A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]". | [Solution](ip_defanging.js) |
| 1342 | Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero | Given a non-negative integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero. If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it. | [Solution](reduce_to_zero.js) |
